# Team 4 Group Project No.2: 

### Central Question & Overview: Are we currently in the midst of another Tech Bubble? 

-- We will analyze the past 10 years of historical data for the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) 
-- We will use traditional TA indicators to break down whether or not these movements in price have been healthy or more momentum-based
-- We will use Sentiment Analysis to look at the past month of news to help guide our decision on whether or not we believe this bubble has time to grow or if it will pop sooner than expected

### Introduction: Brief History on FAANG & Breakdown of Indicators

-- We will give a brief explanation of the current status of these stocks and why we chose this as our topic
They have led the bull-run from 2010 to COVID-19 -- Was it legitimate?
They have continued to outpace the rest of the market since COVID-19 -- Do we believe this is because of societyâ€™s sudden increased reliance on tech or just irrational buying?
-- We will breakdown the indicators we chose a little more in-depth to better explain to the class what each of these really are and how they work (NVI, MFI)

#### Part 1: Momentum TA of Historical Data Analysis

-- We will gather and analyze both price and volume data for the 5 stocks over the past decade
-- We will use a multitude of indicators for each stock to see which ones are the most acutely correlated to the actual price movement of the stock
-- We will analyze whether the movements in trend were easily predicted by the TA or if they more euphoria driven
-- We will break-down our findings to see if this was simply a healthy uptick in price or if the price outpaced bullish indicators by a wide margin (Increased volume, increased indicators, increased sentiment = bubble)

### Part 2: NLP Sentiment Analysis (If we have time)

-- We will use the NewsAPI for Sentiment Analysis to track the past month of news for the FAANG stocks
-- We will use the Vader scores to augment our findings from Part 1 to conclude whether or not we believe the Tech Bubble is popping or not

### Conclusion: Is this a bubble or not?
