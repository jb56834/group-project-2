## Team 4 Group Project No.2: 

#### Team Members: Aaron Sechler, Kevin Machine, Jiaping Bian & Julian Oquendo

### Central Question & Overview: Are we currently in the midst of another Tech Bubble? 

-- We will analyze the past 10 years of historical data for the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) 
-- We will use traditional TA indicators to break down whether or not these movements in price have been healthy or more momentum-based
-- We will use Sentiment Analysis to look at the past month of news to help guide our decision on whether or not we believe this bubble has time to grow or if it will pop sooner than expected

### Introduction: Brief History on FAANG & Breakdown of Indicators

-- We will give a brief explanation of the current status of these stocks and why we chose this as our topic
They have led the bull-run from 2010 to COVID-19 -- Was it legitimate?
They have continued to outpace the rest of the market since COVID-19 -- Do we believe this is because of societyâ€™s sudden increased reliance on tech or just irrational buying?
-- We will breakdown the indicators we chose a little more in-depth to better explain to the class what each of these really are and how they work (NVI, MFI)
