# Team 4 Group Project No.2: 

### Proposal : How do trading decisions made by Algorithmic Trading compares with Sentiment Analysis
Our project is on studying what Algo thinks vs. what the Media thinks on FANG stocks performance for 2020. For the Algo side, we would apply algorithmetic trading techniques (SMA,EMA,RFF) to generate trading signals on FANG stocks, demonstrated by dashboard and evaluation. For the Media side, we gather articles on FANG stocks and aggregate sentimental analysis on published articles at time points when Algo signals a decision. Then we want to compare how the decisions made by algo differ from public views when trading FAANG.  

Sources of Data: YTD FAANG peformance data (January 1, 2020 - September 30, 2020): **Google Finance**
nwews sources: for NLP scores from News ApI, Daily Scores for ideally 5 years max. (Articles upto amonth old) we can ue Google Trends too.

Techniques: **Algo trading, NLP**


Tools: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook

Part 1 - (X)Is there an acutal relation between the sentiment of the stock and how the stock is traded the next day (Y)?
Part 2 - If yes, can we train a model that maximizes the returns to compare with other stocks, energy, or health care, momentum
Part 2 - 


### Things to do: 
- Discuss idea again with instructors
- Complete trading signals of EWA, EWV and BB
- Ask how to present on non-local dashboard 
- Start with NLP sentiment analysis with estimated dates based on FB SMA
