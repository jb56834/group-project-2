# Team 4 Group Project No.2: 

### Proposal : 
Our project is on studying what Algo thinks vs. what the Media thinks on FANG stocks performance for 2020. For the Algo side, we would apply algorithmetic trading techniques (SMA,EMA,RFF) to generate trading signals on FANG stocks, demonstrated by dashboard and evaluation. For the Media side, we gather articles on FANG stocks and aggregate sentimental analysis on published articles at time points when Algo signals a decision. Then we want to compare how different the decisions made by algo with public views in trading FANG.  

Techniques: Algo trading, NLP
