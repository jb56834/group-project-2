# Team 4 - Group Project No.2

### Proposal : 
We will be perfoming a deep-dive into what an algorithm thinks vs. what the media sentiment is for the FAANG stocks performance for 2020. For the algorithm portion, we will apply algorithmic trading techniques, such as SMA,EMA & RFF, to generate trading signals for the FAANG stocks, which will then be demonstrated with a dashboard for easy evaluation. For the media portion, we will gather news articles on FAANG stocks & aggregate sentimental analysis on published articles at the corresponding points in time points in which the algorithm signals a decision. Then, we will compare the difference between the decisions made by the algorithm with the public viewpoint in mind.  

Techniques: 1) Algorithm Trading 2) NLP

### Things to do: 
- Discuss and confirm idea again with instructors
- Complete trading signals of EWA, EWV and BB
- Ask how to present on non-local dashboard 
- Start with NLP sentiment analysis with estimated dates based on FB SMA
